April 9th, 2013. The day I started in the front-end world. It has been one year since I wrote my very first byte of code as a professional developer and a lot has changed since.

[Mkt Virtual](http://www.mktvirtual.com.br "Mkt Virtual's Website") gave me the opportunity to work in this amazing position even knowing that at the time I had nothing more than two months of Codecademy and StackOverflow. I clearly remember my agony when I faced the first PHP file that I had to edit. However, I somehow managed to survived and I will tell you how.

## I didn't give up
My first month at my new shiny job was like hell. Even the easiest thing like adjusting the alignment of some elements in a page was difficult for me. Each challenge required many open tabs in Chrome and a lot of copying and pasting and testing.

As any front-end developer know, if you do not follow a path and write good code you will dive into darkness when trying to make something work in all browsers (especially if you have to support IE7 like me).

I didn't know how to write good code, so I had to write hacky code above hacky code to make something work as expected. After some weeks doing this I was already learning some good patterns and having less headaches with simple things. As they say, you just learn by doing.

## I read a lot
The beauty of the front-end development is that it's community is big and collaborative. There are literally thousands of books and articles about almost any subject you may want to know about. In my very first day at Mkt Virtual I subscribed to some of the best blogs about front-end and bought a book: [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do)

Everyday after 7PM I was reading about how this front-end world works and learning best practices with well-known developers. I'm sure this was and still is the key to become great at front-end development.

## I was not afraid to ask
Mkt Virtual is known to create amazing websites to amazing clients. So there must be amazing developers there, right? Yes!

I probably annoyed Bruno and Galv√£o, two great developers there, with questions about (now) simple stuff. But this was very important for me, as I was trying to learn how they do crazy stuff to do awesome stuff too. Not every problem I had was easily found in Google or StackOverflow.

## I had side projects
If the "you just learn by doing" thing is true, having side projects is the best way ever to learn. I love JavaScript and I was also studying CoffeeScript (we use it at Mkt Virtual), so I created [Moon](https://github.com/hugobessaa/moon "Javascript Framework Moon"). It was a great ride learning interesting things like doing stuff without jQuery, scoping, closures, instances, animations, documentation, tests, continuous integration and the list goes on.

Try hard to do fun stuff on your free time, but do fun programming stuff too. You will be surprised with all the byproducts you will have at the end.

## This is just the start
If in one year I already wrote Moon, deployed three websites to production, gave three talks, read a lot, learned dozens of tools, collaborated with Open Source projects and more, I'm amazed with what I can do next, with the help of my new nerd friends. I'm excited with the possibilities.
